This folder has the input data for each element/structure represented in WEAP model.

Parameter | Significance of Parameter | Element | Value | Quality of Data | Required Data|
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
Storage Capacity | Maximum volume available for water allocation to meet the objectives | Tarbela | 7.7 MAF | Verified | As it is
| | | Mangla | 7.4 MAF | Verified | As it is
Initial Storage Capacity | The initial storage in the reservoir before the start of the operation | Tarbela | 3.6 MAF | Uncertain | Detailed Time series data is required which is missing in the WEAP model
| | | Mangla | 0.54 AF | Uncertain | Detailed Time series data is required which is missing in the WEAP model





Volume Elevation Curve | This curve is used to calculate the volume of the reservoir for a particular elevation and vice versa | Tarbela |(https://git.io/fxF0g) | Verified | As it is |
| | | Mangla | (https://git.io/fxFuG) | Verified | As it is |
Evaporation | Losses due to evaporation reduce the water level in the reservoir, thus affecting the available water to allocate for the objectives | Tarbela | 180mm per year| Uncertain | Detailed Time series data is required which is missing in the WEAP model|
