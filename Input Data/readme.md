This folder has the input data for each element/structure represented in WEAP model.

Parameter | Element | Value | Significance of Parameter | Quality of Data | Required Data
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Volume Elevation Curve | Tarbela | (https://git.io/fxF0g) | This curve is used to calculate the volume of the reservoir for a particular elevation and vice versa | Verified | As it is
Evaporation | Tarbela | 180mm per year| Losses due to evaporation reduce the water level in the reservoir, thus affecting the available water to allocate for the objectives | Uncertain | Detailed Time series data is required which is missing in the WEAP model
